                                improve the world with technology everyday with my entrepreneurial passion too. <br><br>

                                I am a third year Singapore Polytechnic student specialising in Software Development. I
                                have
                                experience creating both node js and Java J2EE full stack web applications.<br><br>

                                I have experience in AR, VR and mix reality working with unity and C# building
                                application
                                such as training simulators.<br><br>

                                Furthermore, I have worked with image recognition technologies like OpenCV and machine
                                learning libraries like TensorflowTensorflow GPU enabled and to create various image
                                recognition models based on business needs such as illegal parking detection and people
                                counting. I also have experience working woth various Anaconda libraries and
                                tools.<br><br>

                                I have learnt to also do programming for data science where I clean datasets and process
                                them using analytical libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn with jupyter
                                notebook to generate useful business insights.<br><br>

                                Moreover, I have also experienced working with IOT devices such as Arduino boards to
                                create
                                magnetic gates that can be controlled via API to open or close the gate through web
                                application or mobile application after valid processing.</p>
